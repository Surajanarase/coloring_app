## What is Rheumatic Heart Disease?

Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is a serious condition that damages the heart valves. It happens when a simple sore throat infection is not treated properly with medicine.

### How Does It Start?

It all begins with a **sore throat** caused by bacteria called Group A Streptococcus. When this infection is not treated with proper antibiotics:

- The body's defense system gets confused
- It starts attacking the heart instead of just fighting the germs
- This damages the heart valves over time
- The heart has trouble pumping blood properly

## The Story of Maria

Maria is a young girl who loves to play with her friends. One day, she got a sore throat and fever. Her parents thought it was just a common cold and gave her home remedies instead of taking her to a health clinic.

### What Happened to Maria?

- **Week 1**: Maria had a sore throat and fever
- **Week 2**: She felt better after home remedies
- **Week 3-4**: She started feeling sick again
- **After a few months**: Her joints (elbows and knees) started hurting
- **Later**: She got tired very easily and had trouble breathing

Maria's parents finally took her to a health clinic, where doctors discovered she had developed Rheumatic Fever, which was damaging her heart.

## Warning Signs to Watch For

If you or someone you know has these symptoms, visit a health clinic immediately:

- **Sore throat** that lasts more than 2-3 days
- **Fever** with throat pain
- **Joint pain** especially in knees, elbows, ankles, or wrists
- **Chest pain** or discomfort
- **Shortness of breath** or getting tired easily
- **Rapid heartbeat** or irregular heart rhythm
- **Swelling** in hands, feet, or belly

## Why Home Remedies Are Not Enough

Home remedies like herbal teas, gargles, or traditional medicines might make you feel better temporarily, but they **cannot kill the bacteria** that cause strep throat.

### The Danger of Waiting

- The bacteria continue to live in your body
- Your immune system keeps fighting
- This can lead to Rheumatic Fever in 2-4 weeks
- Rheumatic Fever can damage your heart permanently

## The Right Treatment

### For Sore Throat (Strep Throat)

1. **Visit a health clinic or doctor immediately**
2. **Get tested** to confirm strep throat
3. **Take antibiotics** as prescribed (usually Penicillin)
4. **Complete the full course** even if you feel better
5. **Rest and drink plenty of fluids**

### If You Already Have Rheumatic Fever

- **Monthly antibiotic injections** to prevent heart damage
- **Regular check-ups** with a doctor
- **Medicine** to reduce inflammation
- **Rest** during the acute phase
- **Healthy diet** and lifestyle
