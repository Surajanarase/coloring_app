**rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in children**.

# What it is (definition)

Rheumatic heart disease is permanent damage to the heart valves that follows **acute rheumatic fever (ARF)** — an autoimmune reaction that can occur after infection with *Group A Streptococcus* (strep throat or skin infections). It most often affects children and adolescents in low- and middle-income settings. ([World Health Organization][1])

# Cause & basic mechanism

1. Initial trigger: untreated or poorly treated *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A strep) infection.
2. Immune reaction: antibodies and T-cells cross-react with cardiac tissue (molecular mimicry), causing **pancarditis** (especially valvulitis). Repeated episodes increase valve scarring and dysfunction. ([NCBI][2])

# Typical presentation in children

* **After a sore throat** (weeks later) children may develop: fever, migratory polyarthritis, chorea (involuntary movements), subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and **carditis** (new murmur, tachycardia, heart failure signs).
* Carditis may be clinically silent early — echocardiography often detects valve involvement before a murmur is obvious. ([AHA Journals][3])

# How it’s diagnosed

* **Clinical criteria (Jones criteria, revised)** combine major and minor features plus evidence of preceding strep infection. Criteria are adapted for population risk. Echocardiography (Doppler) is essential to detect carditis/RHD. Lab evidence: elevated acute-phase reactants and streptococcal serology (ASO/anti-DNase B). ([AHA Journals][3])

# Key investigations

* **Echocardiogram** — assesses which valves (mitral most common) and severity.
* ECG, chest X-ray, inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), throat culture or rapid strep test, streptococcal serology. ([AHA Journals][4])

# Treatment (acute and longer-term)

* **Acute ARF:** treat presumed/confirmed strep with antibiotics (penicillin), and control inflammation (NSAIDs such as high-dose aspirin; corticosteroids for severe carditis). Supportive care for heart failure if present. ([World Health Organization][5])
* **Secondary prevention:** long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (usually benzathine penicillin G IM at regular intervals or oral penicillin) to prevent recurrent ARF and progression of RHD; duration depends on age and severity (often many years or until adulthood). Regular follow-up with echo and cardiology. ([pascar.org][6])
* **Advanced disease:** surgical repair or valve replacement when valve damage causes severe symptoms or cardiac dysfunction. ([AHA Journals][4])

# Prevention & public-health measures

* Prompt diagnosis and adequate antibiotic treatment of strep throat/skin infections (primary prevention).
* Secondary prevention programs (registers, regular penicillin prophylaxis) reduce progression and complications. WHO has recent guidelines and recommends programmatic approaches in high-burden areas. Research into vaccines is ongoing. ([World Health Organization][5])

# Prognosis

* Varies by severity and access to care: many children recover from a single mild ARF episode, but **recurrent ARF** leads to progressive valve scarring and increased risk of heart failure, arrhythmia, need for surgery, and premature death. Effective secondary prophylaxis dramatically reduces progression. ([NCBI][2])
